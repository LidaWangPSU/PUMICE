## PUMICE

PUMICE (**P**rediction **U**sing **M**odels **I**nformed by **C**hromatin conformations and **E**pigenomics) is a tool to create gene expression prediction models for transcriptome-wide association studies. Specifically, PUMICE leverages tissue-specific 3D genomic and epigenomic data to define regions that harbor cis-regulatory variants and prioritize them accordingly.
